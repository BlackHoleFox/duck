# Rustastic Util

`rutil` contains functions I use in other projects but don't want to make a dedicated crate for.

**No backwards compatibility guarantees on this specific crate. The API can change at any time without warning.**

## Usage

Add `rutil` as a dependency in Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
rutil = "0.1"
```

See examples and docs at [https://docs.rs/rutil](https://docs.rs/rutil).
